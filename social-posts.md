## REDDIT - r/googleworkspace

**Title:** Built a free tool to audit Google Workspace for inactive users

**Body:**
Hey r/googleworkspace,

I've been working on a tool to automate Google Workspace security audits, specifically focused on finding inactive users and unused licenses.

Most G-Suite admins I talk to spend hours manually checking:
- Who hasn't logged in 30/60/90 days?
- Which users are just taking up license slots?
- What files are orphaned with no owner?

I built a simple tool that does this automatically. Right now it's in early access (50% off launch price).

**What it does:**
- Detects inactive users (customizable thresholds)
- Finds orphaned files with sensitive data
- Weekly automated audit reports
- HIPAA compliant

**Launch pricing:** $99/month (early access: $49)

**Link:** https://gaudit.io

Would love feedback from fellow IT admins. Is this something you'd use?

## REDDIT - r/sysadmin

**Title:** Side project: Automated G-Suite audit tool for IT admins

**Body:**
Hi r/sysadmin,

Quick background: I was tired of manually auditing G-Suite directories at my company and friends' companies. 

So I built a small tool that:
- Finds inactive users automatically
- Tracks license utilization
- Flags security risks

It's not fancy enterprise software - just something that works and costs a fraction of what the big guys charge.

**Pricing:** $99/mo (early access: $49)
**Link:** https://gaudit.io

Any sysadmins here managing G-Suite? Would love to know if this is useful.

## REDDIT - r/dentistry

**Title:** Built a simpler, cheaper dental recall automation tool

**Body:**
Hi r/dentistry,

I know many of you use Open Dental (or considering it). 

A common pain point I heard: manual recall calls take forever, and existing tools like RevenueWell or Adit are expensive ($200-500/month).

I built a focused recall automation tool that:
- Pulls overdue recalls from Open Dental automatically
- Sends SMS + email reminders
- Handles 2-way confirmations
- Is fully HIPAA compliant

**Why different:** Simpler, half the price ($99/mo vs $199-499), deep Open Dental integration.

**Note:** This is in development. Looking for 5-10 dental practices to beta test free.

**Link:** https://dentalrecall.io

DM me if interested in free early access!

## EMAIL TEMPLATE (Cold Outreach)

**Subject:** Quick question about your G-Suite / Dental practice

Hi [NAME],

I noticed [COMPANY] uses [Google Workspace / Open Dental] and thought you might have the same pain point we solve.

**For G-Suite teams:** We built a simple audit tool that finds inactive users and saves license costs. [LINK]

**For Dental practices:** We built automated recall reminders that work with Open Dental. [LINK]

No sales pitch - just looking for feedback. Happy to jump on a 5-min call if this is relevant.

Best,
[FREDRIK]
