## 🎯 ONE-PAGER

### What It Is
NIS2Guide Pro is the first affordable, automated compliance tool for German companies required to comply with the NIS-2 Directive. It guides businesses from scope determination through BSI registration to ongoing compliance management.

### The Problem
- **30,000 German companies** now in NIS-2 scope (vs 4,500 before)
- **March 6, 2026** registration deadline
- **€10M or 2% turnover** fines for non-compliance
- **No affordable SMB tools** currently exist
- Enterprise tools cost **€10K+/year** — too expensive for mid-market

### The Solution
A SaaS platform that:
1. Determines if you're in scope (2-min quiz)
2. Guides BSI registration (step-by-step wizard)
3. Generates required documentation (15 templates)
4. Manages ongoing compliance (dashboard + alerts)
5. Trains staff (cybersecurity academy)

### Target Market

### Market Size
- **~30,000 entities** in scope
- **€30-90M** total addressable market (€100-300/month × 30K)
- Growing as awareness increases

### Competition
- **Enterprise:** Vanta, Drata, Secureframe (€10K+/year) — too expensive
- **DIY:** Consultants, manual processes (40+ hours) — too slow
- **SMB Tools:** NONE EXIST — first mover opportunity

### Pricing
- **Starter:** €99/month (50-100 employees)
- **Pro:** €199/month (100-250 employees)
- **Enterprise:** €499/month (250-500+ employees)

### Go-To-Market
