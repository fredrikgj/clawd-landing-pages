Title: Built a free tool to audit Google Workspace for inactive users

Body:
Hey r/googleworkspace,

I've been working on a tool to automate Google Workspace security audits, specifically focused on finding inactive users and unused licenses.

Most G-Suite admins I talk to spend hours manually checking:
- Who hasn't logged in 30/60/90 days?
- Which users are just taking up license slots?
- What files are orphaned with no owner?

I built a simple tool that does this automatically. Right now it's in early access (50% off launch price).

What it does:
- Detects inactive users (customizable thresholds)
- Finds orphaned files with sensitive data
- Weekly automated audit reports
- HIPAA compliant

Launch pricing: $99/month (early access: $49)
Link: https://gaudit.io

Would love feedback from fellow IT admins. Is this something you'd use?

Title: Side project: Automated G-Suite audit tool for IT admins

Body:
Hi r/sysadmin,

Quick background: I was tired of manually auditing G-Suite directories at my company and friends' companies. 

So I built a small tool that:
- Finds inactive users automatically
- Tracks license utilization
- Flags security risks

It's not fancy enterprise software - just something that works and costs a fraction of what the big guys charge.

Pricing: $99/mo (early access: $49)
Link: https://gaudit.io

Any sysadmins here managing G-Suite? Would love to know if this is useful.

Title: Built a simpler, cheaper dental recall automation tool

Body:
Hi r/dentistry,

I know many of you use Open Dental (or considering it). 

A common pain point I heard: manual recall calls take forever, and existing tools like RevenueWell or Adit are expensive ($200-500/month).

I built a focused recall automation tool that:
- Pulls overdue recalls from Open Dental automatically
- Sends SMS + email reminders
- Handles 2-way confirmations
- Is fully HIPAA compliant

Why different: Simpler, half the price ($99/mo vs $199-499), deep Open Dental integration.

Note: This is in development. Looking for 5-10 dental practices to beta test free.

DM me if interested in free early access!

Title: Found $500/mo savings on software licenses - here's how

Body:
Hi r/smallbusiness,

Quick tip that saved us real money...

Our Google Workspace had 7 inactive users taking up license slots. That's $35+/user/mo down the drain.

Built a small tool to find inactive users automatically. It:
- Scans your G-Suite directory
- Flags users who haven't logged in 30/60/90 days
- Shows unused licenses you can reclaim

If you're paying for more licenses than you need, this finds the waste.

Free to try: https://gaudit.io

No sales pitch - just a tool that works.

🚀 Built two SaaS tools in 2 weeks. Here's what I learned:

1️⃣ Start with validation, not code
2️⃣ Landing pages tell you everything about market interest
3️⃣ $0 marketing budget = creative hustling

Built:
• G-Suite Audit Tool (IT admin pain) → https://gaudit.io
• Dental Recall Automation (dental practice pain) → https://dentalrecall.io

Both are live, both need real user feedback.

The best way to validate? Put it in front of your target audience and measure.

Next phase: Getting actual signups. 🚀

Option 1:
Built a G-Suite audit tool because manually checking inactive users is painful.

Find them automatically → save on license costs.
$49/mo early access: https://gaudit.io

Option 2:
Hot take: Most SaaS tools are too expensive for what they do.

$99 for something that saves $500/mo in unused licenses?
That's not a cost. It's an investment.

Try it: https://gaudit.io

Option 3:
Dental practices: Stop paying $400/mo for recall automation.

$99/mo. Open Dental integration. HIPAA compliant.
